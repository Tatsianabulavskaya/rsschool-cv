## Information about me:
I have been working for a long time as a document support specialist at a state enterprise. I am scrupulous about my work, I have earned authority and trust in the work I do. Friendly and smiling. I won't say that I like to try something new, but it's not the first time I've been interested in frontend development. I have no experience in frontend development yet, but I really want to finally try it. I think that I will succeed, because I treat the tasks carefully, try to understand them and fulfill them to the end.
